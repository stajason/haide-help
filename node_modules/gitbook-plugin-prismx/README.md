### Updated Gitbook Plugin for [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)

Created a new plugin since the original author was slow to merge.

## Usage

Add the plugin to your `book.json`, and disable default GitBook code highlighting:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["prismx", "-highlight"]
}
```

## Options

Override default styles.  All css files must reside in the same folder.

```json
"pluginsConfig": {
  "prismx": {
    "css": [
      "prismjs/themes/prism-solarizedlight.css"
    ]
  }
}
```
